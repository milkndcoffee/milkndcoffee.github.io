              <ul class="faq-q">are these really faq? </ul>
              <ul class="faq-a">sadly, no. this is a website that will most likely not gain traction as it was made just
                for design in mind.
                and thus, not many people will actually come to the site and provide me any questions to display on this
                page. so with that
                in mind, the questions displayed here is to answer those i believe people may ask if they come to meet
                my site. </ul>

              <ul class="faq-q">why lower case? </ul>
              <ul class="faq-a">to give a direct answer, "aesthetics." i understand to some that this may look
                "unprofessional" and improper. in most cases, this is definitely true. but since this is a project i am
                doing on the side and not an actual website that will be utilised by many people i believe it's fair to
                play around w/ certain aesthetics. and as such, this product here contains lowercase and many internet
                'slangs' bahaha.</ul>

              <ul class="faq-q">did you draw all the articles of clothing? </ul>
              <ul class="faq-a">yep, having art as hobby throughout my life definitely has its perks haha (although time
                consuming).</ul>

              <ul class="faq-q">1+1? </ul>
